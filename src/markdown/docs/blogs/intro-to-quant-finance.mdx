## What is Quantitative Finance?

Quantitative finance applies mathematics, statistics, and programming to model markets, value securities, manage risk, and design trading strategies.

## Core Building Blocks

- Probability and statistics for modeling uncertainty
- Linear algebra and optimization for portfolios
- Time series analysis for forecasting and signal design
- Risk management for drawdowns and volatility control

## Where to Go Next

If you are new, start with statistics, Python/NumPy, and a small backtesting project. Build intuition before complexity.
