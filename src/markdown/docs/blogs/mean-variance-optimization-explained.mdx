## Markowitz Portfolios

Mean-variance optimization balances expected return against variance to construct efficient portfolios.

## Intuition

- Diversification reduces idiosyncratic risk
- Efficient frontier: best riskâ€“return tradeoffs
- Risk aversion selects a point on the frontier

## Practical Notes

Use regularization, robust covariance estimates, and constraints to counter estimation error in small samples.
