title: "Risk Parity and Portfolio Construction"
description: "Equalize risk contributions across assets and build robust portfolios."

## Idea

Allocate capital so that each asset contributes equally to total portfolio risk.

## Steps

1. Estimate covariance matrix
2. Compute marginal risk contributions
3. Optimize weights to equalize contributions

## Notes

Use shrinkage and constraints to stabilize estimates; monitor regime shifts.
